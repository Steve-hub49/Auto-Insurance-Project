# Auto-Insurance-Project

This is the repository for Project 2 / Auto Insurance Project (Steve Freeland).

My project involved the creation of a site whereby users can explore auto insurance data based on vehicle and zip code input criteria.

## Data:

- Data was gathered from kaggle.com (insurance_claims.csv)
- Using Python Flask an API was built from the .csv database developed in PostGres.

## Project Steps:

- Creation of a PostGres SQL database table built from the kaggle .csv file
- Incorporated Python Flask to create API from the .csv data
- JS tool (TBD) was utilized to develop tool front end, therby allowing for the query of API data

## Conclusions and Learnings:

TBD

## Limitations of Data Set:

TBD
