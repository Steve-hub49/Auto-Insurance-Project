# Auto-Insurance-Project

This is the repository for Project 2 / Auto Insurance Project (Steve Freeland).

My project involved the creation of a site whereby users can explore auto insurance data based on vehicle and zip code criteria.

## Project Steps:

Project work included the creation of a PostGres SQL database table from the kaggle .csv file. Python Flask was then utilized to create an API from the .csv data. Next, select JS tool (TBD) to query the API.

## Data:

Data was gathered from kaggle.com (insurance_claims.csv). Using Python Flask an API was built from the .csv database developed in PostGres. 

## Conclusions and Learnings:

Aroma, Appearance, Palate, and Taste highly correlate with Overall Review scores. ABV (Alcohol by Volume) is not highly correlated with beer review scores, possibly indicating beer consumers do not care about this product aspect as much as others. There is no linear correlation between Number of Reviews and Overall Review score. The most influential factor across these factors appears to be Aroma.

## Limitations of Data Set:

Results based on user response data. Only analyzed beer with >50 ratings. Beer Advocate is a U.S. site, skewing the data set toward primarily younger American users. No sales data available. No pricing data available. No IBU ratings included in data set.
